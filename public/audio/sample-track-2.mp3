I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To properly set up this file, you would need to:

1. Obtain an actual MP3 audio file (either record one, download from a royalty-free source, or convert from another format)
2. Place the MP3 file in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample-track-2.mp3`

For development purposes, you could:
- Use a royalty-free music site like Freesound.org or Pixabay
- Create a short audio recording and convert it to MP3
- Use a text-to-speech tool to generate a sample audio file
- Find Creative Commons licensed music

The file should be a standard MP3 format that browsers can play natively for use with the HTML5 audio element in your music player application.
