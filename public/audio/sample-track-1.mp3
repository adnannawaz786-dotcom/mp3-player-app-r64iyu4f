I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To properly set up this file, you would need to:

1. Obtain or create an actual MP3 audio file
2. Place it in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample-track-1.mp3`

For development purposes, you could:
- Use royalty-free music from sites like Freesound.org or Pixabay
- Create a short audio clip using audio editing software
- Use a text-to-speech tool to generate a sample audio file
- Download a Creative Commons licensed music track

The file should be a standard MP3 format that browsers can play natively through the HTML5 audio element.
