I cannot generate actual MP3 audio file content as text. MP3 files are binary audio files that contain encoded audio data, not text content.

To properly set up this file, you would need to:

1. Obtain or create an actual MP3 audio file
2. Place it in the `public/audio/` directory
3. Name it `sample-track-3.mp3`

For development purposes, you could:
- Use royalty-free music from sites like Freesound.org or Pixabay
- Create a short audio clip using audio editing software
- Use text-to-speech tools to generate a sample audio file
- Download Creative Commons licensed music

The file should be a standard MP3 format that web browsers can play, typically encoded at 128kbps or higher for good quality.
